<h1>
	<span className="text-gray-500">Markdown Blogging,</span>
	<br />
	<span>Without Setup or Signup</span>
</h1>

**Memos.pub** makes a blog out of any public GitHub repo, instantly, with
beautiful typography, MDX support, and more:

<HomeTry />

It is different that you don't need to sign up or set up anything. In fact, any
repo with some Markdown files is already a blog at
**\<user\>.memos.pub/\<repo\>**:

<HomeGallery />

### Why

-   You want to write, without wasting days setting up a blog.
-   You want to write, without platforms trying to lock you in.
-   You want to write, with a professional reading experience.
-   You want to write, and focus on your writing.

With Memos.pub, you write. We do the rest, ethically.
